# Documentation

If you would like to auto-generate documentation of the packages, you can do so locally by running:
```
./node_modules/.bin/esdoc
```
Using the .esdoc.json file, esdoc will create documentation in the docs directory.

## Checking docs coverage

You will find a coverage.json file in the docs directory. This will contain information about the documentation coverage for each of the different files in this repo.
